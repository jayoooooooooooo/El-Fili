        <p>EL FILIBUSTERISMO
          <br>
          El Filibusterismo (The Subversive) is José Rizal’s darker sequel to Noli Me Tangere, published in 1891. The
          novel centers on Simoun, a wealthy jeweler who is actually Crisóstomo Ibarra in disguise, now bent on sparking
          a revolution after losing faith in peaceful reform. Through Simoun’s manipulations, plans for violent
          uprising, and the frustrations of students and common folk, the book portrays the escalation of resistance
          against oppressive colonial powers and culminates in a failed rebellion and tragic end that reflect the
          complexities of fighting injustice.
